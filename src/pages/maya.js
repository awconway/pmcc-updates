        I am a woman on a mission: maximum comfort. I have a couple of
        two-leggeds on staff, Martin and Danielle, who tend to me 24/7. I can
        usually be found sleeping, snoofing, and generally living like royalty.
        My life was not always so easy, before my hoomans found me at the
        Toronto Humane Society, I had a bit of a "run-in" with a motor
        vehicle... leading to the loss of all of my front teef(sp?). As a
        result, my tongue hangs free as the wind it whistles in. Thanks for
        reading!
