#  Automating pre-procedure fasting instructions

</TopSection>

This program of research will involve: 1) predictive modeling of procedure start times using a large retrospective database of cardiac cath lab procedure scheduling information; and 2) user-centered design principles to create an alert system optimally suited to patient and clinician requirements for the delivery of automated pre-procedural fasting instructions.

*Progress to date:*

- Worked out a process with the Enterprise Data Warehouse to automatically send 'snapshots' of PHS scheduling information for cath labs so that we can build up a database of scheduling data to use in our predictive model.        
- Submitted NFRF grant application - new linkage with Professor Chris Beck (Department of Engineering at UofT)
- REB application submitted for a study to develop user-facing components (i.e. the alerts that patients receive), which will ensure the alert system is optimally suited to patient and healthcare team requirements for providing the automated pre-procedure fasting instructions.
